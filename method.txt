Method for index building:
1. gffread was installed in Conda environment.
2.gff3 index file was converted into gtf.
3. index was created using STAR.
4. I used STAR because of its higher mapping rate and suitability for paired-end data.

Method for sample aligning
1. STAR is used to align RNA fastq sequences resulting in .bam files.
2. total number & percentage of reads/read pairs and number & percentage were listed by reading Log.final.out files.
